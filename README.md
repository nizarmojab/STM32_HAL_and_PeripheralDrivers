STM32_HAL_and_PeripheralDrivers Project Overview 
STM32_HAL_and_PeripheralDrivers is a project focused on implementing custom drivers using the HAL layer to interface and control various STM32 peripherals. This repository includes configuration examples for Timers, CAN protocol, RTC, and Low Power Modes management. Each module is optimized to provide robust solutions for developers aiming to design complex embedded applications with STM32, ensuring high performance and portability.

Features:
Timers: Implementation of basic time generation, PWM signal control, and event capture/compare.
CAN Protocol: Configuration of CAN communication, message filtering, and self-testing modes.
RTC (Real-Time Clock): Setup of a real-time clock for calendar, alarms, and wake-up functions.
Low Power Modes: Management of SLEEP, STOP, and STANDBY modes with custom wake-up procedures.

Hardware Used:
STM32F446RE-NUCLEO Board
CAN Transceivers
LEDs
Resistors
jumper wires
Multimeter
Push button
Breadboard

IDE and Toolchain:
Eclipse-based OpenSTM32 SystemWorkbench
STM32CubeMX (for initial project setup)
GCC ARM Toolchain
